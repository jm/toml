# TOML

A Ruby parser for [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml), built on [parslet](https://github.com/kschiess/parslet).

This is far superior to YAML and JSON because it doesn't suck.  Really it doesn't.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/toml.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/toml)

## Usage

Install this library:

```bash
gem install "toml"
```

It's simple, really.

```ruby
content = <<-TOML

# Hello, this is an example.
[things]
other = "things"
what = 900000

TOML

parser = TOML::Parser.new(content).parsed
# => { "things" => { "other" => "things", "what" => 900000 } }
```

You can also use the same API as `YAML` if you'd like:

```ruby
TOML.load("thing = 9")
# => {"thing" => 9}

TOML.load_file("my_file.toml")
# => {"whatever" => "keys"}
```

There's also a beta feature for generating a TOML file from a Ruby hash. Please note this will likely not give beautiful output right now.

```ruby
hash = {
  "integer" => 1,
  "float" => 3.14159,
  "true" => true,
  "false" => false,
  "string" => "hi",
  "array" => [[1], [2], [3]],
  "key" => {
    "group" => {
      "value" => "lol"
    }
  }
}
doc = TOML::Generator.new(hash).body
# doc will be a string containing a proper TOML document.
```
